    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (16.3 ounce) can refrigerated biscuits</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package taco seasoning</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, halved and sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium red bell pepper, halved and sliced (1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) jar sliced jalapeno peppers, drained (Optional)</li>
       

    </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>

            <li> Place and press biscuit dough into the bottom of the baking pan and halfway up the sides.</li>
            
            <li> Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Leave the oven on.</li>
            
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and cook ground beef until browned and crumbly, about 5 minutes. Drain fat. Stir in taco seasoning and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Transfer cooked meat to a bowl and wipe out the skillet.</li>
            
            <li>Add onion and bell peppers to the same skillet and cook over medium heat until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Combine sour cream, mayonnaise, 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 of the onion-pepper mixture in a bowl.</li>
            
            <li>Layer browned meat, tomatoes, onion-pepper mixture, jalapeno peppers, and sour cream mixture on top of the pre-baked biscuit dough. Sprinkle with remaining Cheddar cheese.</li>

            <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until cheese is lightly browned and bubble, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>

        </ol>
